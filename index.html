		<li>Fort Sumter</li>
			<ul>
				<li>When South Carolina Seceded from the Union on December 20, 1860, Robert Anderson and his 85 men
				were position at Fort Moultrie at Charleston Harbor.
				On December 26, fearing the saftey of his men, he moved his forces to Fort Sumter, in the middle of the 
				Harbor. When politicians and military commanders doubted the legality of this, his position became perilous.
				Just after the inauguration of President Abraham Lincoln on March 4, 1861, Anderson reported that he 
				had only a six week supply of food left in the fort and Confederate patience for a foreign force 
				in its territory was wearing thin.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Bull Run</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Bull Run was also known as "First Manassas" and was fought on July 21, 1861 in Virginia near the city
			of Manassas. It was the first major battle of the Civil War. Just months after the start of the war at 
			Fort Sumter, the Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond, 
			Virginia, which they expected to bring an early end to the rebellion. Popular fervor led President 
			Lincoln to push a cautious Brigadier General Irvin McDowell, commander of the Union army in Northern Virginia, 
			to attack the Confederate forces commanded by Brigadier General P.G.T. Beauregard, which held a relatively 
			strong position along Bull Run, just northeast of Manassas Junction. The goal was to make quick work of the 
			bulk of the Confederate army, open the way to Richmond, the Confederate capital, and end the war. </li>
		</ul>
		<li>Battle of Port Royal Sound</li>
		<ul>The Battle of Port Royal was one of the earliest amphibious operations of the American Civil War, 
		in which a United States Navy fleet and United States Army expeditionary force captured Port Royal 
		Sound, South Carolina, between Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina, on November 7, 1861. 
		Three days after the fall of Fort Sumter in April 1861, President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a blockade 
		of all Southern ports. While that decree had an unintended political impact–the tacit recognition 
		of the Confederacy as a belligerent–it was nevertheless an essential action on his part. </ul>
		<li>Battle of Shiloh</li>
		<ul>On April 6, 1862, 40,000 soldiers came out of the nearby wooda and struck a line of Union soldiers near 
		Pittsburg.The overpowering Confederate offensive drove the unprepared Federal forces from their camps and 
		threatened to overwhelm Ulysses S. Grant’s entire command.</ul>
